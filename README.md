ShellShock

About This Repository
---------------------

This repository contains useful documents which I have written to help educate the 
cybersecurity community on the "ShellShock" bash vulnerability. These documents are 
designed to help facilitate learning, including on how to identify possibly vulnerable 
services and how to remediate such vulnerabilities.

Getting Started
---------------

The best place to start is with the file `ShellShock Overview.pdf`. This is a brief 
presentation which introduces ShellShock, gives some details on the nature of this bash 
vulnerability, and explains how ShellShock can be used against Apache web servers which 
have CGI scripting enabled.
